Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations and simplify asynchronous code flow. A Promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together.

The Promise object has three states:

Pending: The initial state before the promise is fulfilled or rejected.
Fulfilled: The state when the promise is successfully resolved with a value.
Rejected: The state when the promise encounters an error or is rejected with a reason.
