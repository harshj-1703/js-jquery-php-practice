use of static is to create only 1 instance in memory dont create repeat instances.

in a file only mani public class can be there and it will same as the file name

inheritence -> parent children
abstraction -> hide implementations
encapsulation -> access modifiers with that hide things
polymorphism -> multiple forms(overloading and overriding , compile time polymorphism run at compile time like overloading and overrighting run at run time like over riding)
